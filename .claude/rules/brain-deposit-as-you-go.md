# Deposit-As-You-Go Rule

## When to Deposit Immediately
Do NOT batch knowledge deposits at end of session. Deposit **as soon as** any of these occur in conversation:

1. **A design decision is made** — "we'll use X over Y because Z" → deposit as LEARN or update existing SPEC
2. **A contradiction is identified** — "source A says X but source B says Y" → deposit both sides, add to TENSIONS table
3. **An open question surfaces** — "we don't know X yet" → add to INDEX-MASTER Open Questions table immediately
4. **An insight or discovery emerges** — "it turns out that..." → deposit as LEARN
5. **A framework or model is constructed** — any multi-point framework, rule set, or mental model → deposit as LEARN or SPEC
6. **A comparison reveals something new** — tool comparison, approach comparison → deposit as LEARN
7. **An implementation produces unexpected results** — → deposit as LEARN

## How to Deposit Mid-Conversation
- Pause the current task
- Use `/brain-deposit` or write the file directly
- Update INDEX-MASTER.md (fat index entry + backlinks + open questions)
- Resume the task

## The Test
Before moving to a new topic or task, ask: **"Is there anything from the last exchange that only exists in this conversation?"** If yes, deposit it first.

## Why This Matters
- LLM context windows are temporary — conversation knowledge evaporates on session end
- Handoffs are lossy summaries — they capture state, not full knowledge
- The user cannot review and deposit at the pace knowledge is generated
- Every undeposited insight is a single point of failure (one crashed session away from lost)
